1.I believe (and sincerely  hope)  that all of the HTML and CSS that exists has been correctly
implemented. That being said, I left the bio.css and resume.css files relatively bare, so that
I may go back to them at a later date.

2. I have not collaborated with anyone on this assignment, although I have discussed
it in brief with a fellow COMP20 student, Rohun Dhar.

3. I have spent, thus far, approximately 8 hours on this assignment. Coding HTML and CSS
has been fine. Working with git and github has been less than ideal, which has contributed
to a large amount of the time spent on the project.
