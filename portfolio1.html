					<h2>EverQuote Delusional Driving Survey</h2>
					<p>I focused on creating an infographic in Adobe Illustrator highlighting dangerous driving habits. I also created a companion data visualization tool with <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> that utilized EverQuote's 2015 Delusional Driving Survey data to show where traffic violations were occuring across state lines.<br><br>The infographic has since been published to the web blog, which you can read in full <a href="https://www.everquote.com/blog/safe-driving/confused-state-of-distracted-driving-infographic/">here</a>!

					<h2>CodeSquad Student Dashboard</h2>
					<p>
					As a current member of a team of students developing a new dashboard applicaiton for <a href="http://codesquad.strikingly.com/">CodeSquad</a>, I am the lead in UX and interface design, and I will also assist in the development of the React framework.<br><br>I began by creating several disparate moodboards which were reviewed by the client, each contained a different suite of typefaces, color palettes, and iconography. Following the creation of some preliminary wireframes using <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a>, we are just now beginning user testing of several interface designs.

					<h2>GBLS Affidavit App</h2>
					<p>
					I worked as member of a student team to create an Angular app that allowed largely illiterate populations to write affidavits for <a href="https://www.gbls.org/">Greater Boston Legal Services</a>. I assisted with front-end development and interface design.
					<br><br>
					Interface development was a particular challenge, due to the fact that we had to communicate with populations who usually could not read English and had little familiarity with what is often taken for granted as "standard" website design. By iteratively testing interfaces and mockups created in <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/">Sketch</a>, we had success.
