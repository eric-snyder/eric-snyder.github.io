  				<h2>EverQuote's Delusional Driving Survey</h2>
  				<p>I focused on creating an infographic in Adobe Illustrator highlighting dangerous driving habits and a companion data visualization tool with <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> that utilized EverQuote's 2015 Delusional Driving Survey data to show where traffic violations were occuring across state lines.

  				<h2>CodeSquad's Student Dashboard</h2>
  				<p>
  				As a current member of a team of students developing a new dashboard applicaiton for <a href="http://codesquad.strikingly.com/">CodeSquad</a>, I am the lead in UX and interface design, and I will also assist in the development of the React framework.<br><br>I began by creating several disparate moodboards which were reviewed by the client, each contained a different suite of typefaces, color palettes, and iconography. Following the creation of some preliminary wireframes using <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a>, we are just now beginning user testing of serveral interface designs.

  				<h2>Greater Boston Legal Services' Affidavit App</h2>
  				<p>
  				I worked as another member of a team of students who created an Angular app that allowed many, largely illiterate populations to write affidavits in order to work with Greater Boston Legal Services. I assisted in both the development of the front end of the app, as well as the interface design.
          <br><br>
          Interface development was a particular challenge, due to the fact that we had to communicate with populations who usually could not read English and had little familiarity with what is often taken for granted as "standard" website design. However, by iteratively testing interfaces and mockups created in <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/">Sketch</a>, we were able to have success.
