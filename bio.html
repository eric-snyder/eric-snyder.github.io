							<p>I'm a student. Not a great intro, I know, but it's okay because I do cool things with my time. Take this, for example: I used to study Computer Science at Tufts University, but now I've moved on to Engineering Psychology, with a minor in Entrepreneurial Leadership Studies. See how much more interesting that sounds?</p>
							<p>Now my education focuses on sustainable and accessible development of business, technology, and ideas, with human comfort and use as the foremost concern in any situation. I'm a people person.</p>
							<p>That said, I've dabbled in enough code to know my way around C++, attend a few hackathons, and to build the very website you're reading right now! I've dedicated my Computer Science studies to focusing in on web development and security. Talk to me about your latest startup idea, because I'll bet I can help.</p>
							<p>I'm from Upstate New York, a little spot of land in the trees right over the Massachusetts border. Quiet and calm, I've always had a love of the wilderness that I grew up in. It's where my parents grew up. Neither of them went to college, but they helped me in any way they could.</p>
							<p>Other things of note: I'm a gay Eagle Scout, I've got a good talent for making good meals for friends, and I almost certainly want to work for you. Talk to me.</p>
