		<h1>ETS101: Introduction to the Student</h1>
		<p>I was born as Eric Thomas Snyder in August 1996. I've lived in Upstate New York for most of my life.
		   It's a pretty place, but I wouldn't recommend it to a friend, to say the least. I'd be involved
		   with many extracurriculars for most of my childhood, but my high school involvement with the Boy Scouts
		   of America that was probably the most important.</p>
		<p>It wasn't so much that I was trying to start a fight, but I never worked well with authority. So when
		   the organization tried using it's authority to enforce a few distasteful policies, I started my fight.
		   It got me a little bit of notoriety in the news channels around me, and with that story under my belt,
		   I decided to go to a school that would help me keep moving forward.</p>
		<p>So that's how I ended up here. I'm a student at Tufts who now studies Computer Science and Sociology.
		   Certainly not the most obvious mix, but I try to make it work, and I hope to be able to help 
		   ameliorate some of society's biggest issues using some of these skills I learn in my classes.
		   Computers are good for more than just Facebook, after all.</p>
